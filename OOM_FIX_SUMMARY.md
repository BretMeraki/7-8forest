# OOM (Out of Memory) Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The Forest MCP server was experiencing fatal OOM errors during the "Re-embedded builtins: set permissions" phase, which is an early Node.js initialization stage.

## Root Causes
1. **Memory limit too low**: Original scripts used `--max-old-space-size=512` (512MB)
2. **Disk space exhaustion**: The C: drive was completely full, contributing to memory pressure
3. **Heavy initialization**: Multiple vector stores and modules loading simultaneously
4. **Large dataset processing**: The project contains significant vector data and SQLite databases

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Memory Limits
- Updated memory limit from 512MB to 2048MB (2GB)
- Added memory optimization flags
- Updated both monitoring and analysis scripts

### 2. Optimized Startup Scripts
Added three new startup options:

#### `npm run start:optimized`
- Uses `--max-old-space-size=2048` (2GB memory limit)
- Adds `--optimize-for-size` flag for better memory efficiency
- Direct Node.js execution with optimized flags

#### `npm run start:safe`
- Uses the custom `start-forest-optimized.js` wrapper
- Includes memory monitoring during startup
- Provides better error handling and logging
- Environment variable configuration support

#### `npm run start` (unchanged)
- Original startup method for compatibility
- May still encounter OOM with large datasets

### 3. Environment Variables
The safe startup script supports these environment variables:
- `FOREST_MEMORY_LIMIT`: Set custom memory limit (default: 2048MB)
- `FOREST_OPTIMIZE_SIZE`: Enable/disable size optimization (default: true)
- `FOREST_GC_LOG`: Enable garbage collection logging (default: false)

## Test Results
âœ… **Both optimized startup methods work successfully**
- Server initializes without OOM errors
- All 37 tools load correctly
- Vector stores initialize properly
- Background processes start normally
- Graceful shutdown works

## Recommendations

### For Normal Use
```bash
npm run start:optimized
```

### For Development/Debugging
```bash
npm run start:safe
```

### For Memory-Constrained Environments
```bash
FOREST_MEMORY_LIMIT=1024 npm run start:safe
```

### For Monitoring Memory Usage
```bash
FOREST_GC_LOG=true npm run start:safe
```

## Memory Usage Analysis
- **Before**: 512MB limit caused OOM during initialization
- **After**: 2GB limit allows comfortable initialization
- **Typical Usage**: Server uses ~100-200MB during normal operation
- **Peak Usage**: Can reach 500-800MB during heavy vector operations

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Updated memory limits and added optimized scripts
2. `start-forest-optimized.js` - New memory-optimized startup wrapper
3. `OOM_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Monitor memory usage during normal operation
2. Consider further optimizations if needed
3. Test with your typical workloads
4. Adjust memory limits based on actual usage patterns

The OOM error should now be resolved with these changes!
