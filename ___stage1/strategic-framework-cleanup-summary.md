# Strategic Framework Redundancy Cleanup - Summary

## Changes Applied

### 1. **Removed Redundant Stage 6 (Strategic Framework Building)**
- Deleted the entire `buildStrategicFramework()` method from `gated-onboarding-flow.js`
- Removed `framework_built` gate from the gates tracking object
- Updated HTA generation to mark onboarding as complete

### 2. **Updated to 5-Stage Gated Process**
The gated onboarding flow now correctly consists of:
1. **Goal/Dream Capture** (Gated) - Validates goal clarity
2. **Context Gathering** (Gated) - Ensures comprehensive context
3. **Dynamic Questionnaire** (Gated) - Fills all schema blanks
4. **Complexity Analysis** (Gated) - Analyzes goal complexity
5. **HTA Tree Generation** (Final) - Builds the complete learning framework

### 3. **Removed Helper Methods**
- Deleted `generateStrategicFramework()` method
- Deleted `validateStrategicFramework()` method
- Updated `formatGatesProgress()` to remove framework references

### 4. **Updated Documentation**
- Changed class documentation from 6-stage to 5-stage process
- Clarified that HTA tree IS the strategic framework
- Updated completion message to remove framework references

### 5. **Removed Tool**
- Removed `build_framework_forest` tool from MCP definitions
- Removed from deprecated tools list (it's now completely gone)

## Result

The codebase now correctly represents that:
- **HTA tree = Strategic Framework** (they are the same thing)
- No redundant "strategic framework building" stage after HTA generation
- Cleaner, more accurate 5-stage gated onboarding process
- Users complete onboarding when HTA tree is generated

## Key Understanding

The HTA tree IS the strategic learning framework. It contains:
- Learning phases and milestones
- Task decomposition and dependencies
- Progress tracking structure
- Adaptation points
- Success metrics

There's no need for a separate "strategic framework" - the HTA tree provides everything needed for the learning journey.
