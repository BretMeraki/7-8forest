```

### Returning User (2 steps)
```bash
# 1. Check projects
list_projects_forest

# 2. Continue working
get_next_task_forest
```

## Tool Details

### create_project_forest
Creates a new project and automatically builds your learning strategy.

**Parameters:**
- `goal` (required) - What you want to achieve
- `project_id` (optional) - Custom ID (auto-generated if not provided)
- `context` (optional) - Additional context
- `learning_style` (optional) - visual/auditory/kinesthetic/reading/mixed

**Example:**
```bash
create_project_forest "become a web developer"
```

### get_next_task_forest
Returns the single most appropriate task based on your progress.

**Parameters:**
- `energy_level` (optional) - 1-5, your current energy
- `time_available` (optional) - "30 minutes", "2 hours", etc.

**Example:**
```bash
get_next_task_forest --energy_level 4 --time_available "45 minutes"
```

### complete_block_forest
Marks a task complete and captures learning insights.

**Parameters:**
- `block_id` (required) - Task ID
- `outcome` (required) - What happened
- `energy_level` (required) - Energy after completion
- `learned` (optional) - Key learnings
- `difficulty_rating` (optional) - 1-5
- `breakthrough` (optional) - Major insight?

**Example:**
```bash
complete_block_forest --block_id "task_123" --outcome "Completed piano scales" --energy_level 3
```

## What We Removed (Deprecated Tools)

### ‚ùå Complex Onboarding (9 tools removed)
- `start_learning_journey_forest` 
- `start_gated_onboarding_forest`
- `submit_goal_forest`
- `submit_context_forest` 
- `submit_questionnaire_forest`
- `continue_onboarding_forest`
- `check_onboarding_status_forest`
- `get_onboarding_status_forest`
- `build_framework_forest`

**Why removed:** Multi-step onboarding was confusing. Now `create_project_forest` does everything in one step.

### ‚ùå Pipeline Variations (2 tools removed)
- `get_next_pipeline_forest`
- `evolve_pipeline_forest`

**Why removed:** Redundant with `get_next_task_forest` and `evolve_strategy_forest`.

### ‚ùå Ambiguous Desires (7 tools removed)
- `assess_goal_clarity_forest`
- `start_clarification_dialogue_forest`
- `continue_clarification_dialogue_forest`
- `analyze_goal_convergence_forest`
- `smart_evolution_forest`
- `adaptive_evolution_forest`
- `get_ambiguous_desire_status_forest`

**Why removed:** Over-complicated the core flow. Goal refinement happens naturally through task completion.

## Implementation Guide

### Core Principles
1. **Single entry point** - `create_project_forest` is the only way to start
2. **Automatic HTA** - Strategy builds immediately with project creation
3. **No sessions** - No tracking IDs or multi-step processes
4. **Clear errors** - Helpful messages guide users to the right tool
5. **Smart defaults** - Works with minimal input

### Error Handling
When users try deprecated tools, they get helpful redirects:
```
User: start_learning_journey_forest
System: "Forest Suite now uses a simpler approach. 
        Just use: create_project_forest 'your goal'"
```

### Migration Path
1. All deprecated tools redirect to appropriate active tools
2. Existing projects continue to work
3. Old data structures automatically upgrade
4. No user intervention required

## Benefits of Consolidation

### For Users
- **Faster onboarding** - 30 seconds vs 5+ minutes
- **Less confusion** - One clear path forward
- **Better UX** - Always obvious what to do next
- **No analysis paralysis** - Single "next task" recommendation

### For Developers
- **Maintainable** - 16 tools vs 35+ tools
- **Clear purpose** - Each tool does one thing well
- **Testable** - Simple flows are easier to test
- **Extensible** - Easy to add features without overlap

## Summary

Forest Suite is now a clean, focused system that helps users achieve any goal through intelligent task breakdown and adaptive learning strategies. By removing confusing multi-step processes and overlapping tools, we've created a system that's both powerful and simple to use.

**Remember:** If you're ever unsure, just use `get_landing_page_forest` for guidance!
